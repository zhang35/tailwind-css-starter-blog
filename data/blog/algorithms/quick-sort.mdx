    i = low
    
    # we start from the leftmost element and keep track of the index of smaller (or equal) elements as i.
    # While traversing, if we find a smaller element, we swap the current element with arr[i].
    # Otherwise, we ignore the current element.
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] < pivot:
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
            i += 1
    
    # Move pivot after smaller elements and return its position
    arr[i], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i]

        # element smaller than pivot are on the left

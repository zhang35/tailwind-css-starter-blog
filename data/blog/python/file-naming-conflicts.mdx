title: Avoid file naming conflicts with the standard library

Given the file structure:
```
% tree -L 3
.
├── heapq.py
├── merge_sort.py
└── quick_sort.py    
```

I ran heapq.py in VSCode, but all the python files were executed. And an error occured:

```bash
AttributeError: partially initialized module 'heapq' has no attribute 'heapify' (most likely due to a circular import)
```

why? 

This is because the file was named `heapq.py`, which conflicted with Python's standard library module `heapq`.

To avoid any issues, rename the file to something unique like `heapq_example.py`.

# Right way

```python
matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
```

# Wrong way

```python
[[0] * n] * m
```

This will produce unexpected behavior.

It uses the same array m times and hence changing one impacts all rows.

```python
test = [[0] * 3] * 5
test[1][1]=7
print(test)
# [[0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 0]]
```

## Foreign key and relation defination

We can define a foreign key and a relation in `Child` model like:

```python
class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = "parent"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = "child"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    parentid = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Parent.id))
    parent = relationship(Parent)
```

Then we can add a pair of related parent and child:

```python
parent = Parent()
c1 = Child()
c1.parent = parent
session.add(c1)
session.commit()
```

Then we try to delete the `parent` :

```
session.delete(parent)
session.commit()
```

Guess what would happen? It depends.

## Foreign key constraint

Different target database behaves differently when deleting a related parent model in SQLAlchemy:

- `sqlite` : allow this deletion and`c1.parent` would be set `None`.
- `postgresql` : reject this deletion and raise an error:

`IntegrityError: (psycopg2.errors.ForeignKeyViolation) update or delete on table "parent" violates foreign key constraint "child_parentid_fkey" on table "child" DETAIL: Key (id)=(1) is still referenced from table "child".`

We could then go on with a `postgresql`database and discover more funny things.

## Bidirectional reference

The above configuration establishes a `parent` object on `Child` called `Child.parent`.

If we also want to reference `Child` on `Parent` side, we could add the `relationship.back_populates` parameter:

```python
class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = "parent"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    children = relationship("Child", back_populates="parent")

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = "child"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    parentid = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Parent.id))
    parent = relationship("Parent", back_populates="children")
```

Or more concisely by using a single `relationship.backref` :

```python
class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = "parent"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = "child"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    parentid = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Parent.id))
    parent = relationship("Parent", backref="children")
```

Then a `Parent` can reference a collection of items represented by the `Child` by called `Parent.children`.

(`backref` will add a field `children` to Parent model implicitly)

## Disappearance of foreign key constraint

After we add a `back_populates` or `backref` parameter like above, strangely, **the foreign key constraint disappears,** even when the target database is `postgresql` .

We could delete a parent without an exception and `c1.parent` would be set `None`.

Full expamle code:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = "parent"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = "child"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    parentid = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Parent.id))
    parent = relationship(Parent, backref="children")

# engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
engine = create_engine("postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres")
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

session = Session()

parent = Parent()
c1 = Child()
c1.parent = parent

session.add(c1)
session.commit()

print("c1.parent before deletion:", c1.parent)
session.delete(parent)
session.commit()
print("c1.parent after deletion:", c1.parent)
session.close()
```

output:

```
c1.parent before deletion: <__main__.Parent object at 0x7fc9103fb2b0>
c1.parent after deletion: None
```



It will raise an exception by just removing the `backref` parameter.

Change above code line 18 from:

```
    parent = relationship(Parent, backref="children")
```

to:

```
    parent = relationship(Parent)
```

output:

```
IntegrityError: (psycopg2.errors.ForeignKeyViolation) update or delete on table "parent" violates foreign key constraint "child_parentid_fkey" on table "child"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(2) is still referenced from table "child".
```

Still haven&#39;t figured out why exactly it behaves like this. I&#39;d appreciate it if you share your insights.

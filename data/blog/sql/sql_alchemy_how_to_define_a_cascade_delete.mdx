There&#39;re some pitfalls when defining a cascade delete in SQLAlchemy.

See this example:

1. define a `Parent` model and a `Child`model.
1. define a relationship in `Child` model pointing to `Parent` model and set `cascade = "all,delete"`

Then if we delete a `Parent` object, will the related `Child` object also be deleted? The answer is no.

## The wrong way



```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = "parent"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = "child"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    parentid = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Parent.id))
    parent = relationship(Parent, cascade = "all,delete", backref = "children")

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

session = Session()

parent = Parent()
c1 = Child()
c2 = Child()
c3 = Child()
parent.children.append(c1)
parent.children.append(c2)
parent.children.append(c3)

session.add(parent)
session.commit()

print("Before delete, children = {0}".format(session.query(Child).count()))
print("Before delete, parent = {0}".format(session.query(Parent).count()))

session.delete(parent)
session.commit()

print("After delete, children = {0}".format(session.query(Child).count()))
print("After delete, parent = {0}".format(session.query(Parent).count()))

session.close()
```

Output:

```
Before delete, children = 3
Before delete, parent = 1
After delete, children = 3
After delete, parent = 0
```

The children are not affected.

Then we chose to delete the `Child` object instead, replacing:

```python
session.delete(parent)
```

with:

```
session.delete(c1)
```

Output:

```
Before delete, children = 3
Before delete, parent = 1
After delete, children = 2
After delete, parent = 0
```

Unexpectedly, when we delete a child, its parent is also deleted.

## The right way

Just modify the model defining codes as below:

```python
class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = "parent"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    children = relationship('Child', cascade = "all,delete", backref = "parent")

class Child(Base):
    __tablename__ = "child"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    parentid = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Parent.id))

```

Output:

```
Before delete, children = 3
Before delete, parent = 1
After delete, children = 0
After delete, parent = 0
```

now the `Child` objects are correctlly deleted.

## Key points

**In which object you define your relationship with** `cascade = "all,delete"`**, deleting which object will cause the cascade deletion.**



There&#39;s also an alternative way to define the relationship on the `Child` side : define the cascade **on the backref** like:

```
parent = relationship(Parent, backref=backref("children", cascade="all,delete"))
```
